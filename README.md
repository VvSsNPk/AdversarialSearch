# FAUHALMA 
In this assignment we need to play A classic adversarial search task, where we play a game of Chines Checkers variant
called FAUHALMA, Nice wordplay with FAU. This repo contains the game AI code and I will be detailing on how to run the 
code with the AISystemsProject server.

> all my projects so far I have written in rust so cargo package manager and rust are essential to run the code.
# How to Run the Agent
To build the agent you need to run the following command
````cmd
cargo build --release
````
to run the agent you have to run the following command 
````cmd
cargo run --release
````
+ when you run the agent it will give you the board representation and the moves and other error messages in stdout in debug mode
> I did not add any functionality to stop the debug out put. my focus is to just make a good agent.

## TODO
* [x] Implement a proper minimalistic visualization for debugging
* [x] write unit tests 
* [x] Add explanation for the game logic 
* [x] currently a minimalistic algorithm improve it
* [x] Add solution summary and complete this file

# Solution summary
Here you will find the file [solution summary](solution-summary.md) file.
